# Whats-the-weather-like-in-BLANK

## Description

In this repository, I have created a weather application using the Openweather API that allows you to search for current weather, and up to 4 days in the future (5 including the current day). Typing in any valid city will return current temperature as well as windspeed, humidity, and an icon showing the weather.

## Usage

Navigate to the urls located below and type in your city name to begin searching up the weather. You must click the search button in order for the app to process your request. Hitting the enter button will not work.

## Future Development

If I came back to this app in the future, I would make it so that typing in an invalid city name will return an error message. I would also like to include the current time at the current location if possible, though that may require the use of another API. I would also like for the user to be able to search for cities using the keyboard alone meaning the app must be able to process the enter command instead of clicking search. 

## Credits

I googled many concepts referring to concepts used in the making of this application including api calls, fetch requests, rest and spread operators, arrow functions, event listeners, template literals, and different methods. Bootstrap framework and google fonts were both used to help style the application.
